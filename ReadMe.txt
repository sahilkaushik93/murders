We analyze US gun murder data collected by the FBI.

download-data.R - downloads csv file to data directory

wrangle-data.R - creates a derived dataset and saves as R object in rda directory 

analysis.R - generates a plot and saves it to the figs directory


Key points
Ideally, files (code, data, output) should be structured and self-contained
In a project, we prefer using relative paths (path relative to the default working directory) instead of the full path so that code can run smoothly on other individual's computers.
It is good practice to write a README.txt file to introduce the file structure to facilitate collaboration and for your future reference.
Code

########### In terminal ###########
cd ~    # move to home directory
mkdir projects    # make a new directory called projects
cd projects    # move to ~/projects directory
mkdir murders    # make new directory called murders inside of projects
cd murders    # move to ~/projects/murders/
mkdir data rda    # make two new directories, one is data the other is rda folder
ls    # to check if we indeed have one data folder and one rda folder
pwd    # check the current working directory
mkdir figs    # make a directory called figs to store figures

########## In RStudio ########
# pick existing directory as new project
getwd()    # to confirm current working directory
save()    # save into .rda file, .RData is also fine but less preferred
ggsave("figs/barplot.png")    # save a plot generated by ggplot2 to a dir called "figs"
